Types of variables:
There are three types of variables. Local, instance, static.
These variables types help us to understand the scope of data types.

Local variables are declared inside a block or code (e.g., loops, if statements, methods).

upside:
They occupy the memory for shortest period of time. As soon as java is done
executing the block of code, the variables are removed from memory.
Note: Use the debug feature to understand the behavior of the variable.
The code that we write using local variables is easier to debug.

Downside:
    They can only be accessed within the block of code where they are declared.

Instance variables:
These are declared inside a class and outside of a block (i.e.,
they are declared outside of blocks such as if else, switch statements,for loops, etc).

Upside:
They always get a default value.
They can be accessed anywhere within the class regardless of when they were created within your block of code (they are bidirectional).

Downside:
Cannot be reinitialized inside the class.
They stay in memory upon creation of the object even though when they have not been used.
Useful Tip: When debugging, use the step into button to see what happens inside a given method.

Local Vs instance
Whenever possible, go and create local variables.
Only go with instance variables when the problem cannot be resolved with
local variables.

Static variables:
These are declared within the class and we use the static key word.

Upside:
Static variables can be accessed by simply writing the name of the class,
then a dot and the variable name. We don't need to createThey are universal when it comes to
scope and accessibility.
Only one copy is created per class and accessible across multiple objects.

Downside:
Static variables occupy the memory for the longest of all.
They are created even though you don't create any object
of the class.


Uses of variables
Local:
    Whenever we are solving any problem many times, we need local variables
    to temporarily store data. In all those cases, you should be going with
    local variables.
