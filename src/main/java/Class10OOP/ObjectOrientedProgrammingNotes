Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is just a way (set of rules) for writing code
It helps us to write large amounts of code that is easier to change and manage.
There are other ways like functional programming and procedural programming

Why use OOPs
1) It helps us to write large amounts of code easily
2) It also helps us represent the world around inside computers easily
3) Changing code becomes easier
4) Sharing code and collaboration becomes easier

Main concepts of OOPs
1) Classes and objects (This is a base. Not typically considered a pillar)
2) Inheritance
3) Polymorphism
4) Abstraction
5) Encapsulation

Classes and objects
A class is like a map/blueprint/idea/design that we create before we start
building the actual object. Classes have properties/attributes
which help us to figure out how something looks like and they have
behaviors/functions which help us understand how something works.
