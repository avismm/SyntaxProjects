Constructors:
Constructors help us create the objects from the classes in a more
secure and neat way.We can also put any piece of code that we
want to execute when the object of a class is created.

Why should we use constructors?
1) They help us write more secure classes
2) Cleaner code
3) More control over the values that we can assign to the instance fields

Syntax:
1)Usually public access modifier
2) Same name as class name
3)No return type and not void
4) Parameters
5) Body of constructor

Rules
"this" keyword should be used where there is a conflict.
The keyword "this" does not work with static variables.
