Maps:
These are data structures that store key value pairs.
There are different types of maps in Java but we will discuss
1) HashMap
2) LinkedHashMap
3) TreeMap
4) HashTable ==> Not as common lately.
Note: Maps are not part of the collections framework.
Map is the name of the interface. HasMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap and HashTable
are the classes that implement this interface.

Why we learn about maps:
All the other data structures that we have learned can only store one value at a time
and they are indexed. Maps allow storing of key value pairs which makes them a better choice
because we know what we are storing.

Syntax for Maps:
nameOfTheClass<dataTypeOfKey, dataTypeofValue> variableName=new nameOfTheClass<>();
syntax example:
HashMap<String, double> fruits=new HashMap<>();
Note: Keys cannot have duplicates but values can have duplicates

Maps are collections of entries and entries are collections of key value pairs. Maps themselves do not contain key value pairs.
