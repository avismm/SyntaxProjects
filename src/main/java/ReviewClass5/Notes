OOP review class
OOP is simply a way of writing code by following some rules.
There are four main pillars of OOP

1) Inheritance => a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties of another one.
2) Polymorphism
3) Abstraction ==> Used where there is no complete knowledge of something and you write partial code.
4) Encapsulation

Why we learn OOP
1) Code is reusable
2)Easier to write large code
3) Sharing code with others becomes easier
4)Security of the code is increased
5) Changing code becomes easier.

Object:
An object is something that we can physically touch.

Class:
This is a blueprint/design/map that we use to create objects.

String Class:
This is used to store and manipulate text based data.

Creating objects from String class.
