Method overloading
 1) When we have same method with different parameters, it is called
 method overloading. Parameters can be different in 3 ways
 a) Changing the count of parameters
 b)Changing the data type
 c) Changing the sequence.

 Why method overloading?
  1) Cleaner code. No need for multiple method names
  2) Reuse of code. Same name can be reused many times.

Method overriding

When same method is present in parent as well as child,
it is called method overriding. When we override a method, Java prefers the method from the child c
class.

Why do we use overloading?
    1) Provides more implementation options for methods.
