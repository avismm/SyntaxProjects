Enhanced for loop is much easier to understand

Syntax:
for(dataType anyVariableName:nameOfDataStructure)

Limitations:
1) Cannot be used for updating the elements
2) Access the elements in a reverse order

Break keyword
We use break keyword in switch statement or loops
when we want to terminate the loops prematurely.
Using the break can save allot of compute resources

Continue keyword:
This is used to skip the code for the loop
once we hit the key word and java ignores the rest of the code and jumps to the next iteration
