Method overriding:
    When we have exact same method in the parent as well as child class, we call it method overriding.

Why we should learn about method overriding.
    Method overriding gives us allot of flexibility. For example, if a child class doesn't a method
    from the parent, we can changed/override it.

 Syntax:
 class Parent{
 void eat(){
 sout "Fish"
 }
 }
 class child extends Parent{
 void eat(){
 sout "chicken"
 }

 }

 Type Casting in Classes
 In classes, parent classes are considered to be of a bigger data type than child classes.
