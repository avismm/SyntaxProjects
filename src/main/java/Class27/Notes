File?
A file is something that we use to store information.
1) For example, text files are used to store raw data
2) pdf files used to store books and files
3) To store info in form of a table
4 .jpg .jpeg .png files are used to store images
5) .mp4, mkv .mov are used for storing videos

Why we use files
It is easier to move information around as it is just one single file

Folders or directories
These are like containers for files. They can contain many files
We use it to organize information.

File handling:
Involves creating, editing, accessing or deleting files on ea computer with a help of
a programming language.

Steps to work with files
        1) To locate the file. We use the absolute path. e.g., C:/users/syntax/names.txt
        2) We need to have access and a piece of software that can edit/open the file
        3) TO bring the file from permanent storage to the RAMM
RAM
Temporary storage. It is fast but does not store data permanently. When computer is turned off, the data is lost.

What is HSS/SSD/NVME/Storage
This is the permanent storage. It is cheap and slow.

WHy we learn about file handling
    1) So that we can store the data permanently
    2) We can store sensitive data like username and passwords inside the files and keep them secure on your computers.
    This info should not be pushed to github.
    3) All the config infor like urls and types of testing will be stored in the files
