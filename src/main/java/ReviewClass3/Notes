A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. Nested loops are useful in solving complex problems in which
we have nested data or we need to perform nested operations. We can nest a for loop inside a while loop
or a for loop inside a for loop.

Why nested loops
As a tester, we will be needing them to read excel files data
we will be needing them to go through multiple pages and from each page,
we might want to go through multiple items.

Syntax
for(int i=0; i<=4;i++){
for(int j=0; j<=4;j++){
}
}
