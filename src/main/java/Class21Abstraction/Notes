Abstraction is a process of hiding implementation details and showing only
the functionality to the end user.
We use the abstract keyword with methods to avoid the implementation
details.

Why should we use abstraction
    1) Flexibility. No need provide implementation details if we don't want to
    2) Improves maintainability of the system.
    2) Combining it with other concepts such as encapsulation and
    polymorphism to make OOP more powerful.

Rules
    1) We cannot create the objects of the abstract classes.
    2) All the child classes must provide the implementation to the
    abstract methods which are coming from the parent, or we must mark the child
    class abstract.
    3) Abstract classes can also have fully implemented methods
    4) We can have instance or static fields in an abstract class.
    5) Constructors are also allowed.

Note: Classes which are not abstract are called concrete classes
