Access modifiers are keywords that are used in OOP to specify the
accessibility of methods, classes, constructors and other members of the class.

Four types of access modifiers

default: Gives access to everything in that package and not across packages,

public => Everyone can use the method, class, variable, etc. Accessed
everywhere across packages.

private => The object is not accessible outside the current class

protected => Allows access to protected objects within the same package.
The keyword private only lets other packages know about the data
inside of it if it is related to the original class from which the object
with a private identifier was created, e.g., where a class (subclass)
extends the original class. Syntax: classA extends classB


Private is the most restricted. The next one is protected.


Best Practice
Instance Variables/fields/properties/attributes are
private 99% of the time.
99% of the time, constructors are public
90% of the times, methods are public 8% private and rest of the
time, they are default.
