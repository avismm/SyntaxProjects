Super Keyword
     Super keyword is used to access things from the parent class
     We can access instance variables, methods and constructors

  Why should we lear about Super:
  1)Without Super(), we cannot call the constructor from the parent class and we might
  have to repeat that constructor in all the classes and if someone
  declares the fields private, we will not be able to even access te fields in the child classes.
  2) We use the Super to call the fields from the parent class if we
  have the same fields in the child class.

  Rules:
  1) When we use Super(), we must call at least one constructor from the parent class
  because java needs at least one constructor from the parent as it always
  first creates the object of the parent class when we create the object
  of the child class.
  2) When we have same field as local instance and in the parent class as well,
  java prefers the local variables first, then the instance variables, then the instance variables
  of the parent class. However, if we directly want to access a field from the parent,
  we can use the super keyword.
