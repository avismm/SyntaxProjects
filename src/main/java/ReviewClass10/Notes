Sets are data structures that do not allow duplicate elements
Set is the main interface and there are three main classes which implement this interface.
HashSet
LinkedHashSet
TreeSet

HashSet:
       Fastest of all but does not remember insertion order

LinkedHashSet
       Maintains insertion order but it slower than HashSet.

TreeSet.
       Returns the data in sorted order.
       However, insertion is quite slow as elements have to be moved and resorted.
       TreeSet is faster when retrieving data.

Maps.
       Map is an interface that allows us to store key value pairs.
