Nested Loops
Nested loops are loops inside another loops. Just like
if statements.
Why we need them
To solve complex problems that require accessing nested data.
There is no limit on how far we can nest the loops.

Arrays
These are data structures that help to store multiple items in a single
variable and we can use indexes to access the values.
