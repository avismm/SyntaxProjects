Operators: These are symbols which perform an operation on data.
The data on which operations is performed are called operands

Examples:
Arithmetic Operators
These operators help us to perform different mathematical operations.
Addition => e.g., int a=20,b=50; c=a+b;
Subtraction => -
Multiplication => *
Division => /
Modulus =>

Short Hand Operators
These help us to perform mathematical operations  but using a little shorter
syntax.
e.g., int a =70;
add and update the variable: a+=20; => This can also be written as a=a+20;
subtract and update the variable: -=20; => This can also be written as a=a-20;
multiply and update variable: a*=4;=> This can also be written as a=a*4;
divide and update variable: a/=20;=> This can also be written as a=a/20;
modulus and update variable: a%=20;=> int a=10; a%=20 => 10

Relational operators
These help us to compare things
== checks if two values are true
!= checks if two objects are not equal
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to

Logical Operators
    They help us combine multiple conditions.
    There are three main logical operators.
  ! Not
  || OR
  && ANd
 Increment/decrement operators
 ++ increases the value of the variable by 1
 -- decreases the value of the variable by 1
Note:
While loop checks the condition first and then executes the code
do while runs the statement first, and then checks the condition.
