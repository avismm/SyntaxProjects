Methods/functions/behaviours/routines
There are two types of methods.
1. Methods that do not return anything
2. Methods that can return any data type.

Syntax:
dataType methodName(dataType nameOfParameter,dataType nameOfParameter)
This is where we write the logic
return result if method is not void

Int add(int num1, int num2){
int result=num1+num2;
return result;
}
int ==> This will be the return type of the method
add ==> This is the name of the method
(int num1, int num2) ==> These are called parameters
{} ==> These currey brackets represent the body of the method


We will go over stringBuilder Vs String
