Inheritance allows one class to have all properties and classes from another class except
private members and constructors.
We use the extends Keyword.

Why learn inheritance?
1) Faster development
2) It saves space
3) Code re-usability

Syntax:
Class Parent{
}

Class Child extends Parent{

}

Rules:
1) Private members (fields and methods) are not accessible in child classes.
2) Constructors are also not available for child classes directly.

Types of inheritance:
1) Single
2) Hierarchical
3) Multilevel
4) Hybrid
5) Multiple (it is nor supported by java)

1)Single inheritance:
This is when there is only one parent and one child (not very common).

2) Hierarchical:
One parent to multiple children.

3)Multilevel:
Happens when class C inherits from B and B inherits from A and so on.

3)Multiple:
Multiple parent classes and one child class.

Diamond problem in OOP.
The ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A and a further
class D inherits from B and C, so that there is a method in A and B
