Constructors
99% of the times, constructors are public (they use public access modifier).
Constructors help us to build objects from classes easily.
They help us to give initial values to the instance fields.
The name of the constructor myst be the same as the class name.

Constructors don't have any return type. Most constructors are public.
Other than initializing the values, we can have whatever type of code
inside the constructor that we like for example, calling methods, writing
if-else etc.
 Class ClassName{
 String name

 }
