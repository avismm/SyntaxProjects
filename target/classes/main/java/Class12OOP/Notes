Methods/functions/behaviours/routines
There are two types of methods.
1. Methods that do not return anything
2. Methods that can return any data type.

Syntax:
dataType methodName(dataType nameOfParameter,dataType nameOfParameter)
This is where we write the logic
return result if method is not void

Int add(int num1, int num2){
int result=num1+num2;
return result;
}
int ==> This will be the return type of the method
add ==> This is the name of the method
(int num1, int num2) ==> These are called parameters
{} ==> These currey brackets represent the body of the method

Return Keyword
Return is a keyword that is be used to return a value from a method. One the return statement is executed, we exit the method.

We will go over String Vs stringBuilder Vs StringBuffer
String => Can be a literal or object
StringBuffer and StringBuilder ==> These are classes which are used to perform certain operations on Strings.
e.g., StringBuffer sbf=new StringBuffer("Avis") => We are creating a new object sbf of the StringBuffer class and passing a parameter Avis to the class.

Differences:
String                     |        StringBuffer                            |     StringBuilder
Stored on Heap
or String Constant                 Stored on heap                                 Stored On Heap
Pool

Immutable                            Mutable                                        Mutable
(Unless a new object was created,
Java will point to the same string
in memory)
Synchronized                        Synchronized                                   Non Synchronized
(multiple threads can access
the String in memory)
Thread Safe                          Thread Safe                                    Non Thread Safe
less efficient (involves
allot of locking and unlocking
of the object)                       efficient                                      More efficient
