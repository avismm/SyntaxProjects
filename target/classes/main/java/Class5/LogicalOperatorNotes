Logical operators
They will help us to combine multiple conditions on the same line in of statements
There are three types of logical operators. The final answer from the logical operators is always
either true or false.

Operator types
NOT(!)
OR(||) => pipe signs
AND (&&)

NOT(!)
Why we use the NOT operator
1. It can help us to simplify the logic in some of the cases.
2. Code readability will increase

OR(||)
This operator helps to combine multiple conditions in such a way
that as soon as one condition gets true, the whole operation
becomes true

Write a program for user to enter his/hers birth month. Based on the month define the season.
Example: if user is born in March, April, May → season =”Spring”
if user is born in June, July, August →
season =”Summer”  etc …
At the end of the program we should see 1 output as “You were born is season __”.

AND(&&)
Logical AND operator will help to combine conditions in such
a way that it will only give us true of all conditions are true
e.g.,
true && true && true => true
true && true && false => false
false && true && true => false
