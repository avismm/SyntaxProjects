Collections Framework
It is a collections of classes and interfaces which help us to build dynamic programs which are
capable of handling large amounts of data.

Why the collections framework is important.
    Arrays are not good and we need something that is dynamic and more flexible. For example.
    1) Arrays are fixed in size.
    2) No ready made methods so we would have to create our own.
    3) Indexes in arrays can only store one data type.

ArrayLists
    Better version of arrays. It is also index based. It is dynamic so we don't need to provide the size before hand
    and it contains allot of methods to manipulate the date.

Syntax:
    For Arrays, we use this syntax
     DataType nameForArray=new dataType[size];
     String [] arra=new String[5];

     Syntax for ArrayList
     ArrayList<dataType> arr= new ArrayList<>();
      ArrayList<String> arr= new ArrayList<>();

 Methods from the ArrayList
 Size(arrayList) ==> No of elements
 add(Element) ==> adds new elements to the array list
 get(Index) ==> returns the element on a given index
 remove(index) ==> removes the element on the specified index
 remove(Element) ==> removes the element on the specified index
 indexOf(element)==> returns index of element
 Contains(Element)

 Wrapper classes
    They are a special class designed for primitive data types for every primitive data type.
    Thee classes are:
    short => Short
    int=> Integer
    boolean=> Boolean
    short=> Short
    long=> Long
    float=> Short
